After running our train notebooks, an adapter folder will be created in every folder for every PLM-based metric. Run these notebooks after placing them in the parth:  /mitigating_bias/test/ of the authors' repo and after uploading the adapter folders in the same path. Use our requirements.txt file and test data. Our trained adapters can be found in the provided drive link.
